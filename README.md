# Getting Started with Create React App
ABOUT THE POKEMON REVIEW APP 
* i deployed the frontend on VERCEL  
https://pokemon-90fmq6yq7-hfeisal1.vercel.app/

It shows the different charactes of netlify lovers and what each character reprsents . 
As the project stipulates we are to come up with  functions 
In mine a user of the web app is able to :
    a.View
    b.Create 
    c.Rate 
    d.Delete
    d.Submit
 The view takes you to each character card which lets you write a comment review of what you like about the particular pokemon character  , rate the review and submit . One can also delete if desired  

I used a faker api thus unable to load images on rate card 
https://pokemon-moringa.herokuapp.com/pokemon
Thus , this allowed me to fetch poken characters


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

It literally takes ypu down memory lane if you a pokemon lover !!!
